⚠️ Under development. Usable, but experience is very rough right now. I work on this during the weekends. Come back in a month or two. :)

# Aquinas Media Player

A simple and straightforward terminal media player.

Built primarily with people who have a local and organized music collection in mind, with the philosophy that the folder heirarchy is enough.

## Controls

- **Enter** - Play
- **Space** - Play / Pause
- **Up / Down** - Go up / down file list
- **Left / Right** - Expand / contract highlighted folder
- **f** - Seek forward 2 seconds (**F** for 5 seconds)
- **b** - Seek backward 2 seconds (**B** for 5 seconds)
- **d** - Open change directory prompt
- **s** - Open search prompt (Search does nothing atm)

## Progress

State of the interface.

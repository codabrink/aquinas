This is a little media player written for myself.

I really wish I had the time to make this something that I'm proud of, rather than the mess it is today. But for me, this is "good enough" for me for now and serves its purposes.

# Aquinas Media Player

A simple and straightforward terminal media player.

Built primarily with people who have a local and organized music collection in mind, with the philosophy that the folder heirarchy is enough.

## Controls

- **Enter** - Play
- **Space** - Play / Pause
- **Up / Down** - Go up / down file list
- **Left / Right** - Expand / contract highlighted folder
- **f** - Seek forward 2 seconds (**F** for 5 seconds)
- **b** - Seek backward 2 seconds (**B** for 5 seconds)
- **d** - Open change directory prompt
- **s** - Open search prompt (Search does nothing atm)

## Progress
